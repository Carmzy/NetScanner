## Dependencies
If possible that you don't have any of these common libraries, then install them. Also, this program is OS dependent and will not work for other operating systems except for Windows, especially the ones with UAC features. For security purposes, the libraries will not be given explicably...

## Sources
This program potentially works in fully functional Python environments. Datasets must not be used for illegal purposes but only for penetration testing and educational purposes as well.  

## Usage
This program uses only two commands to work. Note that CLI is not possible so you only need to run the program with ease.
- 'wait {time}' parameter is used to monitor current open devices and delays information gathering for a given time in seconds.
- 'all' parameter is used to fully attack all open device for initialization of any DOS attacks.

***Note: You can test this to any networks. Use with caution***
